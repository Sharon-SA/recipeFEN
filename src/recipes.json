Raise heat to medium-high. Toss everything together and, again, spread the mixture out over the whole pan and press a bit into the bottom.

When it's cool, wrap it very well, and cool in the refrigerator for several hours.</li><li>To unmold the cake, wipe the sides and bottom of the pan with a hot, damp towel. Run a thin metal spatula around the edge of the pan. Release the spring, then lift the cake still on the on the removable bottom from the sides of the pan.

In a dutch oven or cast iron-casserole, heat the canola oil until hot and shimmering.  Add the pork and cook over moderately high heat, turning until browned on all sides, about 15 minutes.\nTransfer the pork to a plate and set aside.\nAdd the apple, onion, carrot, celery, garlic and thyme sprigs to the casserole and cook over moderate heat until somewhat caramelized, about 6-7 minutes.\nAdd the smoked paprika and tomato paste and cook until the paste deepens in color, about 3-4 minutes.\nAdd the wine, chicken stock, vinegar and honey and bring to a boil.  Once boiling, reduce to a simmer.\nAdd the pork - the braising liquid should come up about halfway on the pork shoulder - cover the casserole tightly with aluminum foil and place the lid over top.\nTransfer to the preheated oven.  Braise the pork for about 3 hours, turning once halfway through, until very tender.\nTranfer the pork to a clean plate.  Strain the sauce through a fine mesh sieve into a large bowl, gently pressing on the solids with the back of a spoon.\nPour the sauce back into the casserole.  Using two forks, or your very clean hands, shred the pork, discarding any pieces of fat.\nTransfer the pork back to the sauce and gently stir in the mascarpone.  Season the salt the additional smoked salt and pepper.  Cover and keep warm.\nIn a large pot of salted boiling water, add a teaspoon of olive oil.  Add the pappardelle and cook until al dente.\nDrain the pasta and transfer to the casserole with the sauce.\nToss the pasta with the sauce and parsley and thyme leaves until well-coated.\nTransfer the pasta to warm bowls.\nDrizzle with good-quality extra virgin olive oil, sprinkle with a little smoked salt, garnish with a sprig of thyme and serve.",

Pulse until the mushrooms are finely minced and all of the ingredients are well combined. It will help if youve given the mushrooms a bit of a rough chop first, or if you use pre-sliced mushrooms.\nPlace a won ton wrapper on your work surface, turned so that it appears to be a diamond shape.\nPlace a teaspoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper.\nDip a fingertip into the bowl of water and trace along the two edges farthest from you. Bring up the end closest to you, fold over the filling, and pinch the edges together to seal. Make sure youve gently pressed the wrapper around the filling so there are no air pockets.\nStand up your little triangle pocket so that the filling side sits on your work surface. Fold the top point down, away from you, and pinch. Now, give the edges on either side of that fold 2 little pleats and pinch. Your pot sticker will now look like it has wings. Place it on a large plate thats been dusted with a bit of cornstarch, to prevent sticking.  (Traditionally, pot stickers are made with round dumpling wrappers, so if you have them, you can skip the part about folding the top point down.)\nHeat the skillet over medium-high heat. Brush just a few drops of oil onto the hot pan surface, and place 12 of the pot stickers, upright, into the pan. Allow the bottoms to brown. Carefully add 1/2 cup water to the pan and cover it quickly. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed. Remove the pot stickers immediately to another plate to keep warm, and repeat the procedure with the rest of the uncooked ones.\n*Feel like you have to have meat? Substitute 4 oz. of ground chicken (or pork, if you must) for half of the mushrooms, just dont run it through the food processor. Mix the processed ingredients with the ground chicken thoroughly and fill the wrappers as before. Add a full cup of water (instead of 1/2 cup) to the pan, and steam until the water evaporates, about 5-6 minutes.",

      "instructions": "Prepare the pie crust first. In a large bowl sift together flours, sugar and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the bowl. Rub the butter into the flour mixture with your hands until the pieces are small but still visible.\nAdd oil and yogurt to the bowl and stir with a fork to combine. Knead the dough for one minute in a bowl. It will still be fairly crumbly. Transfer to a floured surface and continue to knead until you can form a ball of dough. Divide the dough in half and flatten into two discs. Wrap in cellophane and refrigerate at least one hour.\nWhile the dough chills, create the filling. Add all ingredients to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.\nPreheat oven to 400. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.\nWhen the dough is chilled, remove from the fridge and unwrap. Flour a large, smooth surface. Roll both balls of dough until they are each about  inch thick. Use a cookie cutter to cut heart shapes or use a biscuit cutter/large glass to cut circles.\nPlace half of the pie hearts onto the prepared cookie sheet and add one teaspoon of pie filling to the centre of each one.\nI added personalized messages to each pie using letter stamps I bought at a craft store. I stamped love be mine and honey on the heart shaped dough that would act as the tops of the pies.\nWet your finger and paint it along the edges of each cut out. Place a second dough heart on top of the filling and press down along the edges to secure.\nUse the tines of a fork and press down along the edges to contain the pie filling. Brush a small amount of egg white on the top of each pie. This will give a nice golden colour to the pies.\nBake for 20 minutes.\nMakes 10-12 mini pies (depending on the size of your cookie cutter. Mine was about 3  inches wide)",

Remove from heat and mix with the drained vegetables and turkey.Step 3: Fill two pie crusts with your turkey and vegetable mixture. Carefully top each pie with another pie crust, pinching the sides together. Cut several small slits into the top of the pie crust to allow the pies to vent while cooking.Step 4: Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until the pies are golden brown, about 30 minutes. If the tops of the pies are browning too quickly, place a sheet of foil over the pie crusts and continue to bake. Cool for about 10 minutes before serving.This has to be one of the most delicious pot pie recipes I have ever tasted! What a great way to use up that leftover turkey. Another great substitution for turkey would also be to use a Rotisserie chicken. MMmmmm. I will be trying that soon.Have you ever tried a pot pie recipe? What about a Turkey Pot Pie Recipe?

      "instructions": "Roast Chili Peppers\nPreheat broiler. Select firm, meaty peppers without wrinkles for roasting. Wash thoroughly. Place peppers evenly in a single layer on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Place under broiler. Watch them closely as the skin will blister and turn black within minutes. Turn the peppers after 5 minutes to blister all sides evenly. When done, the pepper skins should be evenly blistered and mostly black. Place roasted peppers in a plastic bag, cover with a kitchen towel and when cool, rub off blackened skin. Tear open and pull out the seed pod and stem.\nSauce\nIn a blender combine the peppers, flour, and half of the suero or buttermilk and blend until creamy. Pour mixture into medium skillet and set over medium-low heat to warm. Add additional suero or buttermilk and stir. Taste and season with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. If the sauce is too spicy, add  cup of crema or sour cream and stir. If the sauce is too thick, add water until desired consistency is reached.\nChicken (Optional)\nIn a pot with enough water to cover, boil chicken breasts 25 minutes or until juices run clear. Drain, cool, and shred. Optional time-saver: shred a store bought rotisserie chicken.\nStacked Style\nFry tortillas in hot oil until softened. Drain on paper towels. Soften tortillas by soaking in sauce one at a time. Place softened tortillas on individual serving plates. Layer with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Repeat process for a total of 3 tortillas for each serving.\nOven Style\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the sauce in an ungreased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Fry tortillas in hot oil just until softened. Drain on paper towels. Fill with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Roll, placing seam side down.\nPour 2 cups of the sauce over enchiladas. Sprinkle with crumbled queso fresco and bake until warm, about 15 minutes. Serve with a dollop of crema or sour cream and your favorite side dish.",

      "instructions": "Preheat the oven to *350. Mix the first seven ingredients in a small bowl.\nCut each rack in several pieces and rub the spices over all the rib sections. You can leave the ribs whole if you like the way they look better--I just think they are easier to handle on the grill in smaller pieces! Pour 4 cups of water and 1 tsp. of liquid smoke in a roasting pan.\nPlace the ribs in the pan, top up. Tightly cover the pan with foil and bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and rest until ready to grill. Meanwhile, add 1 Tb. oil to a sauce pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and saut for 1-2 minutes. Then add the rest of the ingredients for the BBQ sauce to the sauce pan. Simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nHeat a grill over medium-low heat. Brush the ribs completely with BBQ sauce. Place them on the grill and cook for 20 minutes, turning and brushing every 5 minutes until the desired bark has developed.\nIt's fun to make your own BBQ sauce. But in a pinch, buy a bottled variety you like and simmer for a few minutes with the coffee granules!",

(see pictures)\nCream cream cheese  and 30g sugar on low speed until smooth, put in whipping cream, vanilla extract and egg yolks and continue to beat on low speed for another minute until well combined. Transfer cream mixtures to a large bowl and set aside.\nWhisk egg whites until frothy, add in cream of tartar continue to beat until soft peaks. Add in 30g sugar and beat till stiff (as long as egg whites don't fall when overturned, it will be fine, no need to be pointy stiff).\nFold in egg whites to cream cheese mixtures with a rubber spatula.\nSpoon cream cheese mixtures into prepared paper cups. Top with an oreo biscuit.\nBake for 20 minutes in a water bath.\nLeave to cool in oven, door ajar. Cool completely before chilling.\nBest chilled for 3 hours or more before serving.",

      "instructions": "To prepare the skewers:\nSoak 8 bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes. Set aside.\nTo make the sauce:\nCut the top of the dried chili and shake out the seeds. Transfer them into a saucepan along with the prunes, broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, molasses, garlic, pumpkin seeds, cumin, and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and cook for 2 minutes; then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes more.\nUsing an immersion blender, puree the mixture until completely smooth. Return to the heat and simmer, uncovered, for another 15 to 20 minutes. (If you dont have an immersion blender, carefully ladle the sauce into a food processor, and process until smooth, working in batches; then return to the pot.) Set the sauce aside until ready to serve with the corndogs, or if you are making this ahead of time, once the sauce has cooled, transfer it to a container and refrigerate.\nTo prepare the corn dogs:\nIn a mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, cornmeal,  cup of the rice flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt and mix to combine. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well to combine. Add the rice milk and lime juice and mix to combine. The mixture should resemble a thick pancake batter; if more milk is needed, add by the tablespoonful. Cover and refrigerate the mixture if you are not going to be frying right away.\nWhen you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan until it registers 350F on a deep-frying thermometer. While the oil is heating, place the remaining rice flour on a paper plate and set aside. Cut each chicken sausage in half crosswise, to make eight pieces.\nRoll each piece of sausage in the rice flour to lightly coat. Thread the moistened bamboo skewers through the sausage pieces, so that the tips of the skewers are not quite poking out the top. Holding it by its skewer, dip a floured sausage piece into the batter, until it is completely coated. Carefully lift the stick and hold it over the bowl for a few seconds, allowing any excess batter to drip off. Repeat with another skewer. Carefully place two corn dogs into the hot oil and cook until they are crusty on the outside, and dark golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Repeat with each skewered sausage, allowing the oil to return to 350F in between. Serve immediately with the chili.",

In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.\nDip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. This will help the batter adhere.\nGently beat the egg and buttermilk into the flour mixture using hand mixer.\nDip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up.\nPlace the bread and panko crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat.\nGive it a gentle tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.I suggest completing this entire step before starting to fry rings. Its very easy to burn them if youre distracted. I may or may not be speaking from experience.\nDeep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. They should float to the top immediately  if they dont your oil is not hot enough. Turn rings over once during the frying time.\nRemove form oil and transfer to a paper towel to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve warm.\nPreparing Dipping Sauce: Mix Sriracha Chili and Crema thoroughly until completely blended. Use more or less of the chili sauce depending on your heat preference.",

Add a heaping tablespoon of the cookie crumb mixture to each liner, press with the back of a spoon to form the crust. Bake for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, set aside to cool while preparing the filling.</li><li>2. In a small bowl stir together sugar, cocoa powder and salt. In a large mixing bowl add soften cream cheese and sugar/cocoa mix. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth, add melted chocolate, heavy cream and sour cream, beat until combined. Add eggs, one at a time and mix well after each, then add in vanilla. Tap the bowl on the counter firmly a couple of times to release any air bubbles.</li><li>3. Divide batter between the cupcake liners (liners will be full). Tap the pan a couple of times to be sure there are no large air bubble. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the centers jiggle just slightly. (Original recipe called for baking time of 17-20 minutes, mine were done at the 15 minute mark.) Remove pan from oven, let cool at room temp. for 1 hour. Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours or until fully cooled before topping.</li><li>4. Top the cheesecakes: In a medium bowl whisk together heavy cream, powdered sugar and vanilla. Place the bowl in the refrigerator, along with the beaters from your mixer, for 10-15 minutes to get everything well chilled. Add gelatin to a small bowl, add water. When gelatin absorbs all the water microwave for about 10 seconds to heat and melt the gelatin and make it pourable. Set aside to cool a bit. Beat the cream until just before it reaches soft peak stage, check your gelatin to be sure it has cooled slightly but is still a pourable consistency (if it solidified, just pop it back in the microwave for a couple seconds). With the mixer running, slowly pour in the gelatin and finish whipping the cream to soft peak stage.</li><li>5. Top the cakes with a generous spoon full of the whipped cream, using the back of a spoon make a little nest indentation in the top for the cherry filling. Add a spoon full of the cherry filling and you're done.</li></ol>",

      "instructions": "Preheat Oven Temperature to 350 degrees F\nFor the Cake:\nLine the bottom of the round cake pans with parchment paper (I use precut ones sold at baking stores), grease cake pans, also under parchment paper. Set aside.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk flours, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.\nUsing an electric mixer or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment on medium high speed, beat sugar, Earth balance, and brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.\nAdd eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each egg, then add vanilla.\nAdd dry ingredients.\nMix on low speed, just to blend.\nAdd mashed bananas and sour cream; mix until just blended.\nFold in chocolate chips.\nDivide the batter evenly among the two cake pans. Smooth tops.\nBake cakes for 35-45 minutes, until toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.\nTransfer to wire racks.\nLet it cool in the pans for 15-30 minutes.\nInvert cakes onto the wire racks; peel off parchment paper and let it cool completely, about an hour, before frosting.\nFor the Frosting:\nUsing an electric mixer, or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, beat peanut butter, powdered sugar, Earth balance, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.\nPlace 1 cake on a platter.\nSpread 1 1/4 cups of frosting for the inner layer.\nPlace the other cake on top.\nFrost the top and sides with remaining frosting.\nPipe along the bottom edge with a star tip.\nChill frosted cake for 2-3 hours to set.\nGarnish with chocolate chips.\nServe chilled or room temperature. Chilled will result in a firm peanut butter frosting.\nNote: For mess free decorating, put two halved sheets of parchment paper (cut apart) next to each other on the cake platter before putting the cake on it.\nSlowly pull out from opposite ends of the cake when done piping.",

Cook for about 2 minutes until garlic and ginger are fragrant. Add ground coriander, turmeric, cayenne/chilli powder and salt. Cook for 30 seconds. Add the diced eggplant and stir well to coat evenly with spices. Pour in the tin of chopped tomatoes, give it a big stir, then place the lid on and continue to cook over low-medium heat for about 10-15 minutes. Check and stir a few times to ensure it's not catching on the bottom. Turn temperature down a little if need be.\nWhen the sauce has thicken and the eggplant is meltingly soft, check the seasoning once more. Serve sprinkled with coriander/cilantro leaves and steamed rice. Enjoy!",

      "instructions": "Season both sides of the corned beef liberally with pepper. The corning of the beef makes the beef salty enough, so no need to add more.\nHeat 1 TBSP oil in a large, shallow oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and sear each side for about 3 minutes, just to develop a nice brown crust. This will seal in the beef's juices.\nRemove beef to a plate. Pour guinness into the pot to deglaze. Scrape up any browned bits. Add beef broth, pickling spice, brown sugar, bay leaf, and minced garlic. Bring mixture up to a simmer.\nReturn the beef to the pot with any additional juices that have accumulated on the plate.\nCover the pot and place on the bottom rack in your oven. Bake for 2 1/2 - 3 hours, or until a fork can easily be inserted into the meat.\nBaste the meat with the surrounding juices every 30 minutes or so.\nAfter 2 hours, add carrots, parsnips, and potatoes to the pot. They will only take about 25-30 minutes of simmering to cook.\nRemove pot from the oven. Place beef on a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving into thin slices (cut against the grain of the meat). Remove vegetables and arrange them on a serving platter. Cover with foil. Place the pot on the burner and bring sauce to a boil. Add cabbage and cook for about 7 minutes, until it has softened. Place the cabbage on the serving platter with the other vegetables.\nStrain the sauce in the pot and stir in 2 or 3 TBSP of spicy honey mustard until dissolved. Place in a small dish or gravy boat with a ladle and serve alongside the beef.\nAfter slicing the beef and arranging it on the serving platter, ladle the guinness mustard sauce over the top to rehydrate and glaze the beef and vegetables.",

Work everything together with your fingers until the mixture is in course crumbles. You want the butter to remain as cool as possible and still be in pieces. You can do this part with the food processor if you want, but I prefer to just mix by hand because you still have to transfer it all to a bowl, so it's less to clean up.\nAdd the cream, egg, honey, vanilla, and brandy. Knead the dough until it comes together.\nDump the apples in and press them into the dough until they are evenly distributed and you have a nice round ball of dough. As with any bread, handle it as little and as quickly as possible or the scones will be tough.\nOn a floured surface flatten the dough ball into a one inch thick disc. Use just enough flour to keep it from sticking to your hands as this will dry out the dough.\nCut the disc into 8 equal sections.\nPlace scones on the baking sheet and sprinkle with Turbonado sugar.\nBake for approximately 15 - 18 minutes or until they are golden brown.\nMelt butter and drizzle over the top of a warm scone. Oh my...scrumptious :)\nTransfer the rest to a wire rack to cool.\nStore in a sealed container or Ziploc bag. They also freeze well for 3 to 4 months.",

Either beat 3 minutes with a mixer, or get that baking bicep out and mix by hand for a few minutes. fill paper cases half full.\nBake 15-20 minutes until a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean. Cool completely on a rack.\nFROSTING:\nThis is the fun part! add tablespoonsful of cream to the two cups of icing in a bowl, until it gets to the desired stage. Some people like runny, I prefer it a little stiff.\nAdd a few drops of yellow food colouring and mix.\nNow for your chick feathers... add 2 cups coconut to a ziplock bag, drop in some food colouring, seal it up and rub it all with your fingers to dye the coconut. Fun!\nWhen cupcakes are completely cool, ice with yellow frosting. Put the coconut in a small bowl, and dip the cupcakes icing-side down into it to completely cover.\n\nAdd brown M&Ms for eyes, sticking on with a little frosting for glue. Poke orange M&Ms in for the beak... total cuteness.",
